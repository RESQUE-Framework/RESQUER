\title{Generate RRS (Relative Rigor Score) table row for an applicant}
\usage{
get_RRS_tablerow(applicant, add_scores = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{applicant}{The applicant information, as returned by the \code{preprocess} function.}

\item{add_scores}{Shall the scores for the sectors be added as columns?
(This is needed for sorting in the overview report.)}
}
\value{
A data frame with one row containing:
\describe{
\item{applicant}{Character string of the applicant's last name}
\item{Relative Rigor Score}{HTML visualization of the overall RRS score as a circle}
\item{Open Data}{HTML visualization combining waffle chart and ministack, or "N/A" if not applicable}
\item{Open Material}{HTML visualization combining waffle chart and ministack, or "N/A" if not applicable}
\item{Preregistration}{HTML visualization combining waffle chart and ministack, or "N/A" if not applicable}
\item{Reproducible Code/Reproducible Code & Verification}{HTML visualization combining waffle chart and ministack, or "N/A" if not applicable}
}
}
\description{
Creates a data frame row containing the applicant's name, overall RRS score,
and sector-specific scores with visualizations for Open Data, Open Materials,
Preregistration, and Reproducible Code categories. For the overview report,
multiple rows can be combined into a summary table.
}
\details{
The function extracts sector-specific scores from the applicant's RRS data and creates
HTML visualizations for each category. The visualizations consist of:
\itemize{
\item A circular visualization for the overall RRS score
\item Waffle charts showing the distribution of practices
\item Ministack visualizations showing the relative scores
}

The function handles missing data gracefully by returning "N/A" for categories
without scores.
