\title{Update the \code{"forms"} element in a RESQUE JSON file}
\usage{
update_forms(path, newform, test = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Character scalar. Path to the original RESQUE JSON file whose
\code{"forms"} element should be replaced.}

\item{newform}{Character scalar. Path to a JSON file that contains a
top-level \code{"forms"} element. This \code{"forms"} object will be
inserted into the RESQUE JSON.}

\item{test}{Logical scalar. If \code{TRUE}, the function runs
\code{test_forms_json_structure(newform)} before performing the update
and will fail if the new forms JSON does not pass the structural tests.
Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A character scalar giving the path to a temporary JSON file containing the
updated RESQUE content. This file is created via \code{\link{tempfile}} and
is not automatically deleted.
}
\description{
Reads an existing RESQUE JSON file and replaces its \code{"forms"} element
with the \code{"forms"} element from another JSON file. The updated JSON is
written to a temporary file whose path is returned. The original RESQUE
file is not modified.
}
\details{
Optionally, the replacement JSON file can be validated against the expected
forms schema (via \code{test_forms_json_structure()}) before the update
is applied.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
  # Replace forms in an existing RESQUE JSON and validate new forms first
  updated_path <- update_forms(
    path    = "inst/extdata/resque_original.json",
    newform = "inst/extdata/v0.8.1forms.json",
    test    = TRUE
  )

  # Then read via your RESQUE reader
  resque_obj <- read_RESQUE(updated_path)
}
