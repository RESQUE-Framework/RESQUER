    "P_PowerConsiderations": "Sample size determination was based on a tradeoff between time constraints and power considerations. Therefore, we recruited as many participants as possible during a prespecified time window of 12 months. The final sample size of N = 189 (see section Partici- pants) enabled us to detect a correlation between inhibitory control and emotion regulation measures of r = .20 at an alpha level of .05 with a power of .80 as determined using R package pwr (Champely, 2020). In total, we carried out 84 tests to examine the relationship between inhibitory control and emotion regulation success (cf. Ta- ble 2). After Bonferroni-correction (reflecting the most conservative case where the FDR procedure stops at the lowest p value), we achieved a power of .80 to identify effects of r = .30 at an alpha level of .0006 (% .05/84). Power curves are plotted in Supplemental Figure S2. In two former studies that found a significant associa- tion, the correlation between inhibitory control and reappraisal suc- cess in comparable emotion regulation tasks were r = .55 (Tabibnia et al., 2011), and r = .43 (Carlson & Wang, 2007), respectively. In general, recent meta-analytically derived effect size estimates sug- gest that correlations of r = .10, r = .20, and r = .30 should be con- sidered as relatively small, typical, and large in the field of individual difference research (Gignac & Szodorai, 2016). Hence, we consider the present study as well-powered to identify typical to large effects.\n\n",

This sample size permitted a participant-to-parameter ratio of more than five in all models (as recommended by Hatcher & O’Rourke, 2014; see also Kline, 2016). Furthermore, this sample fits about the minimum sample size for the model structure with two latent and six observed variables (cf. Cohen, 1988; Westland, 2010), at an alpha level of 0.05, a power (1–beta) of 0.80, and an anticipated effect size of 0.38 according to the initial model of inhibition related functions in Friedman and Miyake (2004; calculated with the online calculator by Soper, 2018).\n\n",

    "P_Merit": "Inhibitory control represents a central component of executive functions and focuses on the ability to actively inhibit or delay a dominant response to achieve a goal. Although various tasks exist to measure inhibitory control, correlations between these tasks are rather small, partly because of the task impurity problem. To alleviate this problem, a latent variable approach has been previously applied and two closely related yet separable functions have been identified: prepotent response inhibition and resistance to distractor interference. The goal of our study was a) to replicate the proposed structure of inhibitory control and b) to extend previous literature by additionally accounting for speed-accuracy trade-offs, thereby potentially increasing explained variance in the investigated latent factors. To this end, 190 participants completed six inhibitory control tasks (antisaccade task, Stroop task, stop-signal task, flanker task, shape-matching task, word-naming task). Analyses were conducted using standard scores as well as inverse efficiency scores (combining response times and error rates). In line with previous studies, we generally found low zero-order correlations between the six tasks. \n\n",

Therefore, we ran a simulation to determine what proportion of 10,000 ran- dom samples of n = 189 would produce Bayes factors in favor of the null hypothesis (BF01) or in favor of the alternative hypothesis (BF10) if those samples were drawn from a popu- lation of N = 1,000 where a Pearson correlation ranging from r = 0.02 to r = 0.40 exists (approximately equaling τ = 2/3*r, i.e., τ = 0.01 to τ = 0.27). We set a BF10 and BF01 of > 3 as a threshold, that is, at least moderate evidence for the respec- tive hypothesis, given a prior width of 1. This analysis (see Supporting Information Figure S3) indicated that, with our sample size, a BF01 > 3 was obtained in at least 80% of the samples for r ≤ 0.04 (approximately equaling Kendall's τ ≤ 0.03). Vice versa, a BF10 > 3 was obtained in at least 80% of the samples for r ≥ 0.26, (approximately equaling Kendall's τ ≥ 0.17). Thus, in terms of classical power analysis, we had 80% power to find at least moderate evidence for a null effect if it was τ ≤ 0.03 and 80% power to find at least moderate evidence for a true effect if it was τ ≥ 0.17.\n\nStudy 2: A Bayesian analog to power analysis was performed that indicated that with a sample size of N = 102, a BF01 > 3 was obtained in at least 80% of the random samples for r ≤ 0.06 (approximately equaling Kendall's τ ≤ 0.04). Vice versa, a BF10 > 3 was obtained in at least 80% of the samples for r ≥ 0.36, (approximately equaling Kendall's τ ≥ 0.24). Therefore, in terms of classical power analysis, we had 80% power to find at least moderate evidence for a null effect if it was τ ≤ 0.04 and 80% power to find at least moderate evidence for a true effect if it was τ ≥ 0.24 (see Supporting Information Figure S8).\n\n",

[20; N = 35], the probability in the present study (N = 48) was 79% (1-beta) to observe an effect that surpasses the threshold of alpha = 0.05 (one-sided), and 95% to observe an effect that surpasses alpha = 0.2 (one-sided) as calculated in G*Power 3.1 [27]. Because our study did not reveal a one-sided alpha level smaller than 0.2 for vmPFC-amygdala connectivity, the true effect size is likely smaller than 0.73.\n\n",
