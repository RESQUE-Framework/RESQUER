If accepted for publication a submission will appear in the next available issue. If an article is received before 1st August it will be considered for the February issue, if received before 1st February it will be considered for the August issue.  Each paper submitted to our regular issues is first reviewed by the editors and, if it is judged suitable for this publication, is then sent to at least two independent referees for double-blind peer review. Editors and reviewers evaluate manuscripts without regard to the authors' race, gender, sexual orientation, religious belief, ethnic origin, citizenship, or political philosophy. Any manuscripts received for review are treated as confidential documents until publication date. Reviewers do not consider manuscripts in which they have conflicts of interest resulting from competitive, collaborative, or other relationships or connections with any of the authors, companies, or institutions associated with the papers. Decisions are based on the paper’s importance, originality and clarity, and the study’s validity and its relevance to the scope of IJEBCM.  The Special Issue is normally the proceedings of the Oxford Brookes Annual Coaching & Mentoring Research Conference, held the previous January. Papers are invited from conference presenters and are reviewed and edited by members of the editorial board.  Originality, plagiarism, and research ethics IJEBCM is committed to upholding the integrity of the academic record. We encourage authors to refer to the COPE (Committee on Publication Ethics) International Standards for Authors.  Articles submitted to the journal should not have been published before in their current or substantially similar form, or be under consideration for publication with another journal. Authors should submit only entirely original works, and must appropriately cite or quote the work of others. Publications that have been influential in determining the nature of the reported work should also be cited. Please note that submitted articles may be checked with duplication-checking software TurnItIn Feedback Studio.  Authors submitting articles for publication must ensure that the work is not an infringement of any existing copyright. Prior to article submission, authors should obtain permission to use any content that has not been created by them or where they do not entirely own the copyright.  IJEBCM takes issues of copyright infringement, plagiarism or other breaches of best practice in publication very seriously. In the event that IJEBCM discovers or is made aware of any allegation of research misconduct or where the authorship of an article is contested the editors will, where appropriate, implement the COPE (Committee on Publication Ethics) Core Practices by taking the actions indicated in a relevant COPE flowchart. When necessary IJEBCM will take appropriate action including, but not limited to, publishing a correction or retracting the article. If an author voluntarily wishes to issue a retraction, correction, clarification, or apology they should contact the editors.  Authors who wish to challenge a correction, retraction, or other action taken by IJEBCM should contact the editors.  Manuscript preparation Manuscripts should be prepared following the guidance below. Manuscripts will be returned for amendment prior to review if the guidance has been insufficiently adhered to.  The manuscript should be prepared using Microsoft Word (or an application compatible with Word), accompanied by a statement that the text has not been published or submitted for publication elsewhere. Please use Microsoft Word Styles to indicate a clear hierarchy of sections and do not use more than three levels (major section, sub-section, and sub-sub-section) excluding the title. The first page of the manuscript should contain: (i) title of article; (ii) name(s), institutional affiliation(s), and ORCID identifiers (where applicable) of the author(s); and (iii) mailing address, e-mail address and telephone numbers of the author (or primary author, if more than one). In addition, authors are invited to submit a short biography, not exceeding 50 words for a single author or 25 words each in the case of multiple authors - please include the short biography or biographies at the foot of the page.

All figures and tables should be original and be of a reproducible standard and included at an appropriate point in the text. Contributors are responsible for obtaining permission to reproduce copyright material, whether text or illustrations. Titles for figures, tables and diagrams should be positioned underneath the image. Quotations from the literature and respondent quotations of more than two lines should use the Microsoft Word Style 'Quote' and be presented without quotation marks. For shorter quotations use double quotation marks within the text in the Microsoft Word Style 'Normal' or 'Paragraph'. A clear writing style in British (UK) English should be used.

Frontiers in Communications and Networks,"",2673-530X,"""Communication systems and networks are becoming the dominant mode of information access and exchange.

Besides allowing developing economies to leap into the information age without necessarily the costly infrastructure of wiring to every home and office, these technologies are also offering people in more developed economies more freedom and flexibility. These technologies also connect everyday objects (household appliances, cars, thermostats, etc.) to the Internet through integrated devices, enabling seamless communications between people, processes, and devices without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction. Thanks to the combination of data analytics, low-cost computing, and the cloud, with communication and networking technologies, physical objects can share and collect data with minimal human intervention. This leads to a hyper-connected world in which the physical world meets and collaborates with the digital world.


In this context, the objective of Frontiers in Communications and Networks is to publish original, high-level, and timely scientific articles in telecommunication across wireless and wired domains. Papers submitted by researchers from around the world are rigorously reviewed by leading and active international researchers.

Science,1095-9203,"","Science is a leading outlet for scientific news, commentary, and cutting-edge research. Through its print and online incarnations, Science reaches an estimated worldwide readership of more than one million. Science’s authorship is global too, and its articles consistently rank among the world's most cited research.

Science serves as a forum for discussion of important issues related to the advancement of science by publishing material on which a consensus has been reached as well as including the presentation of minority or conflicting points of view. Accordingly, all articles published in Science—including editorials, news and comment, and book reviews—are signed and reflect the individual views of the authors and not official points of view adopted by AAAS or the institutions with which the authors are affiliated.

Science seeks to publish those papers that are most influential in their fields or across fields and that will significantly advance scientific understanding. Selected papers should present novel and broadly important data, syntheses, or concepts. They should merit recognition by the wider scientific community and general public provided by publication in Science, beyond that provided by specialty journals.

Science welcomes submissions from all fields of science and from any source. The editors are committed to the prompt evaluation and publication of submitted papers while upholding high standards that support reproducibility of published research.
