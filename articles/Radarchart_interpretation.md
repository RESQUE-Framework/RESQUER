# How to read the radarcharts of the relative rigor score (RRS)

The general philosophy of RESQUE is: It doesn’t matter so much what kind
of research you do - but when you do it, you should do it in a high
quality. The radar chart helps you to see how many quality indicators
have been fulfilled in multiple areas of methodological rigor.

- The **width** of each sector corresponds to the **maximal number of
  rigor points** one could gain. If you often opt-out of certain
  indicators, then the maximal points get reduced and the sector gets
  more narrow.
- The **colored part** of each sector shows the **achieved rigor
  points**.

In the following examples, we will focus on the **Open Data** sector of
the radar charts.

## “Rarely do it - but when we do it, we do it the right way.”

This candidate had nearly no chance to gain open data points, which can
be seen from the very narrow sector. For example, he submitted many
methodological/purely theoretical papers which had no data, or had
convincing justifications that the data strictly could not be openly
released.

But in the few cases where he could provide open data, he did it in a
perfect way (i.e., according to all FAIR criteria and other indicators
related to open data): The narrow sector has 100% of points.

## “A lot of missed chances: You could have been better.”

In this profile, a lot of open data points could have been gained: The
Open Data sector is very broad. But only very few of these potential
points have actually been gained.

## “Demonstrating expertise: A lot of potential that has been realized”

This candidate had many opportunities of providing open data (the sector
is very broad), and she did it in an excellent way. This is true
expertise: Having both a lot of experience *and* doing it in a proper
way.

## Summary

The chart shows both the *quantity* of points that could have been
gained, and the *quality* of the practice. If you are looking for a
candidate that has a lot of experience in a certain skill *and* does it
in a good way, the respective sector should be both broad *and* filled.
