```

The general philosophy of RESQUE is: It doesn't matter so much what kind of research you do - but when you do it, you should do it in a high quality.
The radar chart helps you to see how many quality indicators have been fulfilled in multiple areas of methodological rigor.

- The **width** of each sector corresponds to the **maximal number of rigor points** one could gain. If you often opt-out of certain indicators, then the maximal points get reduced and the sector gets more narrow.
- The **colored part** of each sector shows the **achieved rigor points**.

In the following examples, we will focus on the **Open Data** sector of the radar charts.

## "Rarely do it - but when we do it, we do it the right way."

This candidate had nearly no chance to gain open data points, which can be seen from the very narrow sector.
For example, he submitted many methodological/purely theoretical papers which had no data, or had convincing justifications that the data strictly could not be openly released.

But in the few cases where he could provide open data, he did it in a perfect way (i.e., according to all FAIR criteria and other indicators related to open data): The narrow sector has 100% of points.

```{r, out.width=400, out.height=400, dpi=200}
#| fig.alt: >
#|   A radar chart with five areas:
#|   Open Data, Open Materials, Preregistration, Reproducible Code & Verification, Theorizing & Formal Modeling.
dat1 <- tibble(
  dimension = c("Open Data", "Open Materials", "Preregistration", "Reproducible Code \n& Verification", "Theorizing \n& Formal Modeling"),
  max_points = c(1, 14, 16, 12, 13),
  rel_score=c(1, 0.3, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3),
  xstart = c(0, cumsum(head(max_points, -1))),
  xend = cumsum(max_points),
  xmid = (xstart + xend)/2
)
RRS <- list(radar_dat=dat1, overall_score=TRUE, n_papers=10)
RRS_radarchart(RRS, show.legend = FALSE, show.n_pub = FALSE)
```


## "A lot of missed chances: You could have been better."

In this profile, a lot of open data points could have been gained: The Open Data sector is very broad.
But only very few of these potential points have actually been gained.

```{r, out.width=400, out.height=400, dpi=200}
#| fig.alt: >
#|   A radar chart with five areas:
#|   Open Data, Open Materials, Preregistration, Reproducible Code & Verification, Theorizing & Formal Modeling.
dat1 <- tibble(
  dimension = c("Open Data", "Open Materials", "Preregistration", "Reproducible Code \n& Verification", "Theorizing \n& Formal Modeling"),
  max_points = c(40, 14, 16, 12, 13),
  rel_score=c(0.1, 0.4, 0.5, 0.7, 0.5),
  xstart = c(0, cumsum(head(max_points, -1))),
  xend = cumsum(max_points),
  xmid = (xstart + xend)/2
)
RRS <- list(radar_dat=dat1, overall_score=TRUE, n_papers=10)
RRS_radarchart(RRS, show.legend = FALSE, show.n_pub = FALSE)
```

## "Demonstrating expertise: A lot of potential that has been realized"

This candidate had many opportunities of providing open data (the sector is very broad), and she did it in an excellent way.
This is true expertise: Having both a lot of experience *and* doing it in a proper way.

```{r, out.width=400, out.height=400, dpi=200}
#| fig.alt: >
#|   A radar chart with five areas:
#|   Open Data, Open Materials, Preregistration, Reproducible Code & Verification, Theorizing & Formal Modeling.
dat1 <- tibble(
  dimension = c("Open Data", "Open Materials", "Preregistration", "Reproducible Code \n& Verification", "Theorizing \n& Formal Modeling"),
  max_points = c(40, 14, 16, 12, 13),
  rel_score=c(0.9, 0.4, 0.5, 0.7, 0.5),
  xstart = c(0, cumsum(head(max_points, -1))),
  xend = cumsum(max_points),
  xmid = (xstart + xend)/2
)
RRS <- list(radar_dat=dat1, overall_score=TRUE, n_papers=10)
RRS_radarchart(RRS, show.legend = FALSE, show.n_pub = FALSE)
```


## Summary

The chart shows both the *quantity* of points that could have been gained, and the *quality* of the practice.
If you are looking for a candidate that has a lot of experience in a certain skill *and* does it in a good way, the respective sector should be both broad *and* filled.
